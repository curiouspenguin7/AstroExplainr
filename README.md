AstroExplainr üöÄ
================

AI-Powered Explanations for Astrophysics Data

AstroExplainr is a solo-built tool that brings together machine learning, LLMs (large language models), and real or simulated space data to analyze, visualize, and explain phenomena like gravitational waves and exoplanet transits‚Äîno PhD required.

--------------------------
FEATURES
--------------------------
‚Ä¢ Upload or Simulate Space Data  
  Easily upload your own CSV/telescope data, or play with built-in simulated datasets (LIGO-style signals, Kepler light curves, etc.).

‚Ä¢ ML-Driven Event Detection  
  Instantly spot spikes, dips, or anomalies in your data using classic machine learning algorithms.

‚Ä¢ AI Explanations  
  AstroExplainr sends flagged data to an LLM (like GPT-4o) to generate natural language explanations or hypotheses‚Äîmaking sense of what‚Äôs happening, fast.

‚Ä¢ Human vs. AI  
  Write your own scientific interpretation and compare it side-by-side with the AI‚Äôs answer.

‚Ä¢ Beautiful Visualizations  
  See your space data come to life with interactive charts, highlighted events, and a clean, user-friendly interface.

--------------------------
QUICK START
--------------------------
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/astroexplainr.git
   cd astroexplainr

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   (Includes: streamlit, matplotlib, scikit-learn, openai, etc.)

3. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py

4. (Optional) Set your OpenAI API key:  
   Create a .env file with:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

--------------------------
EXAMPLE USE CASES
--------------------------
- Upload a simulated gravitational wave signal and get instant, AI-powered scientific hypotheses.
- Spot a ‚Äútransit dip‚Äù in an exoplanet light curve and see if the AI agrees with your analysis.
- Test how LLMs explain real-world NASA data (try it on open datasets from data.nasa.gov!)

--------------------------
FOR DEVELOPERS
--------------------------
- All core logic is in app.py
- Add your own ML models in /models
- Customize or expand datasets in /data
- Want to use a different LLM? Swap out the OpenAI call in ai_utils.py
